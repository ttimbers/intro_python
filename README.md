# UBC Statistics Python Study Group - Introduction to Python

We will first ensure everyone has the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 installed correctly, and that it talks to our IDE (Rodeo). The installation instructions can be found in [settingup.md](settingup.md).

If we have time, we will then learn some intro Python syntax. To do this, we will follow [this lesson](https://github.com/jiffyclub/2015-07-06-scipy/blob/gh-pages/python/00-python-intro.ipynb) from SciPy 2015.

We will use this etherpad to communicate: http://pad.software-carpentry.org/stat-python-study-group
